.SH NAME
.B Simple_Shell 
.br
Program designed to read commands typed by a user and execute appropriate programs in response to those commands.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhsh [command_string] [arguments]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB Simple_Shell\fR is a special-purpose program designed to read commands typed by a user and 
execute appropriate programs in response to those commands. Such a program is sometimes known 
as a command interpreter.

This shell reads the command typed by the user through interactive or non-interactive mode. This shell will interpret 
and execute the command as the user intended. 
.br
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
This is a simple version of the shell. It does not support piping, aliases, file creation, flags and other functionalities such as the command separator (;). This will be implemented in the upcoming versions of the simple shell.

.SH EXAMPLES
For the execution of any command, the shell will accept two modes as previously described. See the following modes for further information. 
.SH MODES
.br
\fBNON-INTERACTIVE\fR - The user doesnâ€™t interact with the shell, it is through an automated process e.g. scripts. This mode is available for this version of the shell. To execute this mode type \fBecho "/bin/ls -la *.c" | ./hsh\fR

\fBINTERACTIVE\fR - The user interacts with the machine through a keyboard. This mode is executed by typing only de command desired e.g. \fB"ls"\fR or with its full path \fB"/bin/ls -la"\fR. 

.SH OPTIONS
At the moment of implementation of this version, options and builtins are not supported completely. However, for coming updates the following builts-ins will be implemented:
.br

\fBcd\fR  
- Directories will be changed by executing this built-in. It will interact according to the different parameters given by the user.
.br

\fBhelp\fR 
- It presents "help" for the user when it is requested. It will shows details related to other commands or built-ins.
.br

\fBenv\fR 
- It will show the environment where the process is taking place. This built-in is already working in this version.
.br

\fBexit\fR 
- It exits the program. The use of number will be installed for the next patch. 

.SH INTERACTIONS

.br

-When the program is started, the machine shows a prompt symbol \fB($)\fR which means the program is ready to receive commands.
.br

\fB($)\fR
.br

The shell executes the command with arguments or without them. It will be executed after the ENTER key press. 

.br
\fB/$ bin/ls -al\fR or \fB/$ ls -al\fR - Will show the list of files and hidden files contained inside the current directory. The argument "-la" will print hidden files in long format (presenting specific details like permissions and users).

\fBCtrl+c\fR - The program will not stop when the **ctrl+C** combination is pressed. The feature is disable.
.br

\fBctrl+d\fR - The key combination ctrl+d will close the program properly with the correct memory free of the buffer designated for the program.
