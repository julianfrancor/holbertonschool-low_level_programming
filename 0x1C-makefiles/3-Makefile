# ======================== VARIABLES ========================
# define the C compiler to use
CC = gcc

# define the C source files
SRC = main.c holberton.c

# replaces the suffix .c of all words in the macro SRC with the .o suffix
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)

# define the name of the executable file
NAME = holberton

# the program to delete files
RM = rm -f

# ========================== RULES ==========================
# all: builds your executable
all: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

# clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
# $~ --> deletes the Emacs temporary files ending with "~"
clean:
	$(RM) $~ $(NAME)

# oclean: deletes the object files "-f"
oclean:
	$(RM) -f $(OBJ)

# fclean: deletes the Emacs temporary files, the executable, and the object files
fclean: clean oclean

# re: forces recompilation of all source files, the all implicit will take the SRC
re: oclean all
