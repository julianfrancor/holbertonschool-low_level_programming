## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What did I learn from this project:

* Look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
 - The & (bitwise AND) in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and
   does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if
   both bits are 1.
 - The | (bitwise OR) in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and does
   OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the
   two bits is 1.
 - The ^ (bitwise XOR) in C or C++ takes two numbers as operands and
   does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the
   two bits are different.
 - The << (left shift) in C or C++ takes two numbers, left shifts the
   bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of
   places to shift.
 - The >> (right shift) in C or C++ takes two numbers, right shifts the
   bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of
   places to shift.
 - The ~ (bitwise NOT) in C or C++ takes one number and inverts all bits
   of it.
